# Sustainability Insights

Sustainability is a growing concern for companies as we all work to reduce our impact while conducting business. The first and biggest step to that end is power consumption, which happens to be one of the largest costs associated with running an IT department and data center. As our insights and visibility increase, so will our dashboards. 

The carbon emission analysis follows a methodology based upon [EPA's eGRID emissions factors](https://www.epa.gov/egrid) and electricity use model described in the [IOP publication on data center growth](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaec9c#references).
