# R-Laning Guidance

By leveraging the Cloud Recommendation Engine within Device42 this report visualizes which of your infrastructure are candidates that can be rehosted to public cloud based on supported OS images, or which systems have OSs that are not supported and will require some element of replatform and refactoring.
Easily see which operating systems and applications may be the simplest or most complex to move to public cloud.
